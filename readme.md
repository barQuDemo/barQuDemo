Howdy! Welcome to our MVP, BarQu (name subject to change)

The problem we are trying to solve for people:
We believe in bridging the gap between google places API which only provides historic data and word of mouth from individuals in cities as to what's going on in the evening in terms of "night life." With BarQu, we can finally bridge this gap by creating an application that provides realtime updates as to how many people are frequenting a location with all the added benefits and power of a traditional api to provide information about this location in question. This empowers users with knowledge and helps users make better decisions as to how to optimize their "fun" when considering bars to check out local to Charleston.

===========
===========

The code we are trying to display:
Front-end: React
Back-end: Java with Spring Boot

The front-end will display in function: realtime updates,

The back-end will display in function: CRUD functions, postgreSQL or MongoDB, user authentication, Websockets for chat function in app, bluetooth (potentially), managing routes

===========
===========
User Goals: To view the most popular bar based on foot traffic in real time by opening the app. Single page app usage, designed for quick reference and with simplicity in mind.

Features list and their importance:

1. Update bars by foot traffic in real-time
2. CRUD functions for clients to edit and make changes to their info
3. Database to hold for crud functions
4. Basic Authentication
5. Chat Box (websockets)
6. Possible API integration
6. Emoji's or symbols to share onclick
7. Facebook authentication
